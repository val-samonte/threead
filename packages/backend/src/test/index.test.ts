 * - api.test.ts: REST API endpoint tests
 * - moderation.test.ts: AI moderation service tests (requires wrangler dev)
 * - vectorize.test.ts: Vectorize semantic search tests (requires wrangler dev)
 * - health.test.ts: Health check endpoint tests
 * 
 * This file is kept for potential unit tests that don't require the full worker environment.
